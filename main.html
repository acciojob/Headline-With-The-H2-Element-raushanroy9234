The code you provided seems to be missing the opening <html> tag. Also, the placement of the <h2> element outside of the <body> tag can cause issues as it should be placed inside the <body> tag. The correct structure for an HTML file should have the <h2> element within the <body> tag, like this:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Acciojob</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>
    <!-- the entire body must be written by the student -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./script.js">
		
    </script>
    <h2>Acciojob</h2>
</body>

</html>
